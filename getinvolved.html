	<h3>Start Something</h3>

	<p class="padding">Being a Big Brother or Big Sister is one of the most enjoyable things you’ll ever do. Not to mention, one of the most fulfilling. You have the opportunity to help shape a child’s future for the better by empowering him or her to achieve. And the best part is, it’s actually a lot of fun. You and your Little can share the kinds of activities you already like to do.</p>

	<h2>Enroll a child</h2>
	<p>If you believe having an additional adult role model in your child’s life would be a good thing, then you’ve come to the right place. Every year, we match thousands of kids from all over New York City with an adult volunteer mentor who is ready, willing, and able to provide a child with the friendship, guidance, and advice s/he needs to achieve a brighter future. There is no cost to you to have your child join our program. And more than one child per family can join at any time. Our only request is that each child be committed to this program  for 8 hours per month, for a minimum of one year.</p>

	<h4>Become a mentor</h4>
	<p>As the nation’s founding and NYC’s largest mentoring organization, our program is simple: by meeting just twice a month on their own schedules in the community, our volunteers are able to make a positive, often life-long impact on a child in need. We match volunteers over the age of 21 with children between 7-17 in all 5 boroughs of New York City. We are especially in need of volunteers from or willing to travel to the outer boroughs, and have a high demand for male volunteers for the nearly 100 boys currently on our wait-list.</p>
